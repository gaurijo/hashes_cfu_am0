# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

*The last section in hashes 2 file, iterating over a hash using each method but only printing values that were equal to true.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

*I do best when I can take notes in a physical notebook. Ink to paper helps me remember and absorb information a lot more quickly.I take the most notes when I'm reading through a lesson, before doing CFU

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

*I try my best to troubleshoot in the moment, because sometimes it'll be a silly error, like missing a key. But I'm trying to be more proactive about taking steps before I get overwhelmed. For the part I struggled with today I went to Stack Overflow and was able to find a simple solution to what I was struggling with.
